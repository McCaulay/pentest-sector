## Insecure File Permissions
Check file permission access
```sh
icacls "C:\Program Files\Serviio\bin\ServiioService.exe"
```

If a service has incorrect file permissions, we may be able to replace the executable with a malicious executable to create a reverse shell or add a user to the system. Then restarting the service, or if it autostarts on boot, rebooting the machine will execute that service.

## Leveraging Unquoted Service Paths
Get list of running services.
```powershell
Get-WmiObject win32_service | Select-Object Name, State, PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}
```

If a service path is unquoted and contains a space (eg Program Files), it can treat values after spaces as arguments.

Eg: `C:\Program Files\My Program\My Service\service.exe` will attempt the followin paths:
- `C:\Program.exe`
- `C:\Program Files\My.exe`
- `C:\Program Files\My Program\My.exe`
- `C:\Program Files\My Program\My service\service.exe`

If we can write an executable in any of these places it will run when the service is restarted instead of the actual executable file.

## USBPcap
Driver exploit, ensure OS / Version and Architecture are correct as these can cause Blue Screen Of Death. Dangerous!

## PowerShell Empire
Uses serveral techniques such as misconfigurations, unquoted service paths, improper permissions on service executeables and more.
```sh
usemodule powershell/privesc/powerup/allchecks
