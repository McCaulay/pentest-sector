# .dtors

---

.dtors specifies the deconstructor function in a C program if provided.

Get the start and end address of .dtors.
```sh
nm ./example | grep DTOR
```

`__DTOR_LIST__` is the .dtor start and `__DTOR_END__` is the end of the .dtor.

Dump the contents of the .dtors.
```sh
objdump -s -j .dtors ./example
```

We can write the address of our shellcode in our [environment](/{{route}}/{{version}}/buffer-overflow/environment) to the `__DTOR_END__` address using an [arbitary write string format vulnerability](/{{route}}/{{version}}/format-strings/overview#writing-to-an-arbitary-memory-address).
