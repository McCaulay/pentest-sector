## Interactive Shell

1. If python is available (or python3), spawn an interactive shell.
```sh
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
2. Background the process.
```sh
[CTRL + Z]
```
3. Note the terminal from the following output.
```sh
echo $TERM
```
4. Note the number of rows and columns of the shell from the following output.
```sh
stty -a
```
5. Do not process input and output such as [CTRL + C], but instead pass them through to the shell. Do not echo commands back. Then bring the shell process back to foreground.
```sh
stty raw -echo; fg
```
6. Reset the terminal.
```sh
reset
```
7. If "unknown terminal type unknown Terminal type?" shows, enter `xterm-256color`.
8. Export the terminal that you noted down previously.
```sh
export TERM=xterm
```
8. Export the shell you are using.
```sh
export SHELL=bash
```
9. Set the rows and columns of the terminal.
```sh
stty rows 60 columns 235
```
